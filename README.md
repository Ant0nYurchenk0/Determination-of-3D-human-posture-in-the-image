Use point_cloud.py to generate point cloud from rgbd images. For this you need rgb image, depth image and tranjectory log. You then can generate mesh from the point cloud using methods in the same file.

Use pcd_from_mesh.py to generate point cloud from a downloaded mesh

Use skeletonize.py to create any skeleton from a mesh. The code also draws trend lines on specified points
